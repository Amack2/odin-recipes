<h2>About Spicy Pork</h2> 

<p>What kind of side dish looks nice and special but is very simple to make? Hot soup is a good answer but something fatty will also be a good choice, as long as it’s very delicious.</p>

<p>Spicy-stir fried pork is the perfect dish that I was thinking of. Just follow the recipe and make a delicious, irresistible, spicy, shiny, stir-fried pork dish in 15 minutes! I posted the video and the recipe years ago on my website, and it’s also one of my cookbook recipes, but this updated version is slightly modified and improved.</p>
     
<p>This time I used pre-cut pork sold at a Korean grocery store, but you can also just get pork belly at your local butcher and cut it into think pieces about 1/8 inch thick. You could also replace pork belly with chicken breast, slightly frozen so you can slice it thinly and nicely. </p>
    
<p>Serves 3 to 4</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound pork belly, cut into bite size pieces (1/8 inch thick)</li>  
  <li>¼ cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)</li>

  <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
